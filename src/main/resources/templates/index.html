    <h2>About Junior Talent Lab</h2>
    <div class="red-underline"></div>
    <p>
        The UBS Junior Talent Lab is a fresh learning format where mediamatics trainees receive real assignments from colleagues and implement them independently as a team. In a creative, self-organized environment, the learners develop practical solutions, strengthen their professional skills, and tackle new challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Lab offers a simple platform where employees can submit their project ideas and small tasks. The learners then review and work on these assignments, providing clear feedback upon completion. The system ensures structured workflows, open communication, and a transparent overview of all active projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        This way, not only useful products and services are created, but also strong personalities for the future.
