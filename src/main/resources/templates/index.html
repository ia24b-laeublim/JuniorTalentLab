        <p class="cardText">
            The UBS Junior Talent Lab is an innovative learning platform that bridges the gap between education and
            professional practice. Here, media specialist apprentices receive authentic assignments from UBS professionals
            and work on them independently as teams, fostering creativity, self-organization, and practical problem-solving
            skills in a real business environment.
        </p>
        <div class="more-text">
            <p>
                The Lab provides a streamlined platform where UBS employees can submit project ideas, tasks, and
                business challenges of various types - from creative photo assignments to technical development tasks.
                Apprentices can browse, accept, and work on these assignments, receiving guidance and feedback from
                experienced professionals throughout the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                This collaborative approach ensures structured workflows, transparent communication, and clear project
                oversight. The platform tracks progress, facilitates feedback exchange, and maintains a comprehensive
                overview of all active and completed projects, creating a valuable learning ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                By working on real business challenges, apprentices not only develop technical skills but also gain
                insights into professional workflows, client requirements, and business priorities - preparing them
                for successful careers while delivering tangible value to the organization.

                and reflect on your learning journey. This section also showcases your accomplishments and skill development.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>For Employees:</strong><br>
