        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 2025</p>

        <p>UBS AG ("UBS," "we," "our," or "us") operates the UBS Junior Talent Lab ("Talent Lab," "Platform") to connect internal media professionals ("Mediamaticians") with task requests from UBS employees.</p>

        <p>We engage only trusted third-party vendors for hosting, analytics, and email delivery, sharing the minimum information necessary under binding confidentiality agreements. We disclose personal data only when required by law or to protect our legal rights.</p>
